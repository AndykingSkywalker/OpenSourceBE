# Open Source Backend Project

> This is a Java SpringBoot application that links to my front end application [Please See Here](https://github.com/AndykingSkywalker/OpenSourceFe2)

## How to use my app

> Simply clone this repository by using `git clone {url}` and then open the project in Eclipse.

> Once you have the project open you can start the SpringBoot server and begin to utilise the Restful API

## Help with API requests

> I have used Swagger in this project to create detailed documentation for my API, Please navigate to `localhost:8088/swagger-ui/index.html` once your server is running to be able to view this and to experiment with it.
